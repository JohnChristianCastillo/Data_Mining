# Generating the retail dataset
First we have to make the executable from the makefile. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:
```
make
```
This will create the executable file
```
For example the executable generated by the bf version accepts the following arguments: 
    dataset: the dataset to be used
    minsup: the minimum support
    depth: the maximum depth of the association rules
    output: the output file name
```
An example of running the executable is:
```
 ./executable_name ./retail.txt 5 10 ./output.txt
